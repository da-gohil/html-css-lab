NEW CONCEPTS:

A) @media (CSS): this was used for small screens. In order to adjust styles for small screens like changing background images, font sizes, and navigation bar behavior.
B) Column Layout - Here I have used grid and flex both which has helped me to organize components without worrying about aligning each component on webPage.
C) Float - I have not used since, the page layout was constantly getting messed, so i choose Flex instead.
D) Overflow - This is a property which we use for keep things in a content in control.
In the code, I have kept it hidden, but we can change the background color and make it to visible to see it's change.
